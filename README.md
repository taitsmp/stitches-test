to test `pnpm run dev`

### Notes

- I used `pnpm` b/c yarn was broken on my fedora laptop.
- prettier installed with no eslint
- Examples - https://github.com/radix-ui/design-system
- Docs - https://stitches.dev/docs/introduction
- If you get weird errors that you can't figure out it's probably b/c you messed up a variable / token.
